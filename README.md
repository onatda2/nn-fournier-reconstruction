# Neural Network Image Reconstruction

## Description:
This repository contains my implementation of a multi-layer neural network designed to "memorize" images using various input feature mapping strategies. The various mapping strategies were from this paper: https://bmild.github.io/fourfeat/ . The project was completed as part of the Spring 2023 CS 444 course assignment.

## Project Overview:
In this project, I implemented a multi-layer neural network and employed backpropagation for image memorization. The network takes 2D coordinates as inputs and produces RGB pixel values as outputs. The goal is to reconstruct images based on pixel coordinate inputs. The assignment involved multiple stages, including implementing forward and backward passes, experimenting with different optimizers and input feature mapping strategies, and training the network on both low and high-resolution images.

## Usage:
To replicate the experiments and results, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/onatda2/nn-fournier-reconstruction.git
Set up in Google Colab or locally.
Follow the instructions in neural_network.ipynb to run experiments, train networks, and visualize results.

## Results:
Detailed results, training curves, and image reconstruction outcomes are available in the results pdf. The report template contains discussions on the effectiveness of different optimizers and feature mapping strategies.
